# SixthDice
It's a Dice Roll game made in Java and Android Studio using POO, which uses two six-sided dice for each player (2 players).

# Rules:

+ The winner will be who rolls a six.
+ If both players have rolled a six, the player with the highest score wins.
+ If both players have rolled a six and the same total sum of the two dice in each player, it is a tie.
